### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a  I am 21 years old and have been progressing day by day on the way to become a passionate developer and coder since 2013 with a self-developed developer slogan. At that time I started building small automation systems using .NET (C #) and Windows Forms. For some Bots connecting to Telegram API node js. and I made an in-depth transition to object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python. Currently, I am a new graduate of Gaziantep University Computer Programming. I am also doing research on python and artificial intelligence. I have created many open source projects on GitHub to work extensively on new technologies, IoT (Internet of Things) or New programming languages, and to publish and document the knowledge I have learned so far for everyone in the open source and free software community. In these projects, I usually work with things like Python, C / Javascript / PHP, NodeJS or - as Frontend - Angular, Vue (also used for this page) or React. Overall, I have collected some experience with general DevOps and distribution tools such as Docker / docker-compose, CI / CI (GitLab, GitHub Actions) and CMS such as Git or SVN. I have used a number of database services for my special projects like MongoDB, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL or MySQL. Also, I am Experienced in installing, maintaining and configuring Linux servers (ubuntu, debian, centos, fedora). To summarize the works I have done, I have some e-commerce site works.
